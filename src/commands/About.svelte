    I used to be a university professor [and still is a part-time one] specialized in the technical,
    economical, sociological and philosophical implications of web-based decentralized organizations.
    I've been teaching in
    <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/" target="_blank">centrale / supélec</a>,
    <a href="https://www.univ-rennes2.fr/" target="_blank">université rennes 2</a>,
    <a href="https://www.esgi.fr/" target="_blank">ESGI</a>.

    More recently I have spawned and led [technically, at least...] a couple of projects like the
    <a href="https://www.distributedgallery.com" target="_blank">distributed gallery</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/pandonetwork" target="_blank">pando network</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/AragonBlack" target="_blank">aragon black</a>.
    Since then, I figured out I dislike managing teams. That's why I started working as a freelance
    solidity and web3 dev with organizations such as
    <a href="https://aragon.org" target="_blank">aragon</a>,
    <a href="https://www.robinhoodcoop.org" target="_blank">robin hood coop</a>,
    <a href="https://www.curvelabs.eu/" target="_blank">curve labs</a>.
