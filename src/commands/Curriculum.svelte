  I used to be a university professor [and still is a part-time one] specialized in the technical, economical, sociological and philosophical implications of
  web-based decentralized organizations. I've been teaching in:
</p>
<a href="toto">centrale / supélec</a>
<a href="toto">université rennes 2</a>
<a href="toto">ESGI</a>

<p>More recently I have spawned and led [technically, at least...] a couple of projects:</p>
<a href="https://www.distributedgallery.com" target="_blank">distributed gallery</a>
<a href="toto">pando network</a>
<a href="toto">aragon black</a>
<p>Since then, I figured out I dislike managing teams. That's why I started working as a freelance solidity and web3 dev with organizations such as:</p>
<a href="toto">aragon</a>
<a href="toto">robin hood</a>
<a href="toto">curve labs</a>
