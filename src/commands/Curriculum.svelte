  I used to be a university professor [and still is a part-time one] specialized in the technical, economical, sociological and philosophical implications of
  web-based decentralized organizations.
  I've been teaching in <a href="toto">centrale / supélec</a>, <a href="toto">université rennes 2</a>, <a href="toto">ESGI</a>.

  More recently I have spawned and led [technically, at least...] a couple of projects like the <a href="https://www.distributedgallery.com" target="_blank">distributed gallery</a>, <a href="toto">pando network</a>, <a href="toto">aragon black</a>.
  Since then, I figured out I dislike managing teams. That's why I started working as a freelance solidity and web3 dev with organizations such as <a href="toto">aragon</a>, <a href="toto">robin hood</a>, <a href="toto">curve labs</a>.
